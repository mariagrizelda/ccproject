```

## 🔄 Service Communication Flow

```
1. User → http://localhost/api/auth/register/
2. Nginx → routes to auth_svc:8001
3. Auth Service → processes request
4. Auth Service → saves to MySQL
5. Auth Service → returns JWT tokens
6. User → stores tokens in localStorage

Later requests:
1. User → http://localhost/api/courses/ (with JWT in header)
2. Nginx → routes to courses_svc:8002
3. Courses Service → validates JWT
4. Courses Service → queries MySQL
5. Courses Service → returns course data
```

## 🗄️ Database Architecture

All services share ONE MySQL database:
- **Host**: `db` (Docker network)
- **Port**: 3306
- **Managed by**: Auth service (runs migrations)
- **Models defined in**: `shared/models.py`
- **Used by**: All 4 microservices

## 🚀 Deployment Flow

1. MySQL starts and becomes healthy
2. Auth service starts:
   - Waits for MySQL
   - Runs migrations
   - Seeds data (insert_data)
   - Scrapes programs
   - Starts Gunicorn on 8001
3. Other services start:
   - Wait for MySQL and Auth service
   - Start Gunicorn on their ports
4. Frontend starts:
   - Waits for all backend services
   - Starts Next.js on 3000
5. Nginx starts:
   - Waits for all services
   - Starts reverse proxy on port 80

## 🔍 Health Check Strategy

Each service exposes `/health/` endpoint:
- Returns `{"status": "ok"}`
- Used by Docker health checks
- Checked every 10 seconds
- 5 retries before marked unhealthy

## 📊 Service Responsibilities

### Auth Service (authsvc)
- ✅ User registration
- ✅ JWT authentication
- ✅ User profiles
- ✅ Database migrations (only this service)
- ✅ Data seeding (only this service)

### Courses Service (coursessvc)
- ✅ Course listing
- ✅ Course details
- ✅ Course reviews
- ✅ Assessment information per course

### Catalog Service (catalogsrv)
- ✅ Program catalog
- ✅ Program search
- ✅ Assessment types
- ✅ Study areas
- ✅ Program levels

### Planner Service (plannersvc)
- ✅ Planned courses CRUD
- ✅ Semester planning
- ✅ User course selections

## 🎯 Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each service has a single responsibility
2. **Independent Scaling**: Scale services independently based on load
3. **Fault Isolation**: If one service fails, others continue working
4. **Technology Flexibility**: Could replace individual services with different tech
5. **Team Organization**: Different teams can own different services
6. **Deployment Flexibility**: Deploy services independently
7. **Better Monitoring**: Monitor each service separately

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Old API app**: Kept in codebase but NOT used by any service
2. **Migrations**: Only run by auth service to avoid conflicts
3. **Shared Database**: All services use same MySQL instance
4. **Nginx Required**: Services not directly accessible (except for debugging)
5. **Health Checks**: All services must pass health checks before serving traffic

## 🧪 Testing the Conversion

```bash
# 1. Start services
docker-compose up -d

# 2. Wait for all services to be healthy
docker-compose ps

# 3. Test each health endpoint
curl http://localhost/api/auth/health/
curl http://localhost/api/courses/health/
curl http://localhost/api/catalog/health/
curl http://localhost/api/planned-courses/health/

# 4. Test frontend
open http://localhost

# 5. Test registration
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/auth/register/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "testuser",
    "email": "test@test.com",
    "password": "testpass123",
    "program_level": "UNDERGRAD",
    "program": "Computer Science",
    "year_intake": "SEM1"
  }'

# 6. Test courses
curl http://localhost/api/courses/

# 7. Test catalog
curl http://localhost/api/catalog/programs/
```

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Test All Endpoints**: Verify each endpoint works correctly
2. **Load Testing**: Test with concurrent requests
3. **Monitoring**: Set up Prometheus/Grafana
4. **Logging**: Centralize logs with ELK
5. **Backup**: Set up database backups
6. **CI/CD**: Automate deployment
7. **Security**: Review and harden security

## 🎉 Success Criteria

- ✅ All 4 microservices running
- ✅ Nginx routing correctly
- ✅ Database shared properly
- ✅ Health checks passing
- ✅ Frontend working
- ✅ All API endpoints functional
- ✅ JWT authentication working
- ✅ Documentation complete
